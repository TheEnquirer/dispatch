<h1 id="ps2">intro</h1>

<p> 
Because the sim never really ended up working.. instead of a video, I'm making a sorta blogpost type thing instead.
</p>
<p>
I initially was working on the Games on Graphs module with the large group, then broke off to work on a different type of sim right before the presentation. Instead of a histogram, I wanted to actually <i>see</i> the graph change and evolve. So, initially, I made this:
<h2 id="ps2">v.1</h1>
</p>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="initial_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p> 
This code ran the game on every click. It accepted a pairwise function for two nodes that retured a probability of their connection. This function was ran for every pair, forming the weighted edges, then the node would play along its highest weighted edge. (Nodes priority was selected in a random order, and then both nodes were removed from the pool once they played a game).
</p>
<p>
The game above was played with the pairwise function 
 <p><span class="math display">\[p(x, y) = \frac{x}{y}\]</span></p>
where
<td><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></td> 
is the score total of the source node, and 
<td><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></td> 
is the score total of the target node.
</p>
<p>
And some patterns started to emerge -- the red nodes would group together towards the center, opposite a cluster of blue nodes with greens in between them. But it wasn't really that comphresensible. The graph was far from elucidating. I tried playing with a lot of constants, and trying many different pairwise functions. A couple of the highlights are:
</p>
<h3 id="ps2">
v1.2 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    p(x, y) = \sin ^{2}(x)+\sin ^{2}(y)
    \)</span>
</h3>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="sinsr_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p> 
This one would form a sort of star shape in the middle, often with blues and greens on the outside spikes.
The surface of this function is:

This one was pretty cool -- it would form two hemispheres which were internally strongly connected and weakly connected across the two halves. Each hemisphere was color consistent, with a mix of greens (which makes sense as they are meant to be chameleons).
</p>
<p> 
Here's what it looks like with 200 nodes (beware, a bit laggy in the middle):

<p> 
This one would form either seperate components dominated by one color but interestingly not homogenous. Sometimes the groups would steal nodes from eachother, or bridge themselves with nodes forming a long chaing or two distinct barely connected large groups.
</p>
<p> 
Here it is with 200 nodes, which tends to form lots of distinct almost-homogenous groups that are connected in a chain more clearly.

    but I wasn't happy.
</p>
</h2>
<p>
The graph didn't evolve in the way I wanted, and the code was filled with janky hacks and bugs from prolonged constant-fiddling and functionality tinkering. After hours, I finally gave up on my code. 
</p>
<p>
I resolved to rewrite it from scratch. But this time, I'd do it with the cavalry.

<h1 id="ps2">
<p> 
    part 2: the cavalry

<p>
<i> aka albert. </i>
</p>

<p> 
This time, I commandeered albert. Instead of a pairwise function determining a probability of connection and using those as weighted edges, the edges would be weighted by how often nodes played eachother. Pairings would be made by a global function which took in all the nodes and spit out a list of pairings at every game step. With the increased efficiency, we also had the game play mutiple times a second instead of on user interaction. We worked together, re-implementing everything with a new framework and new game model. After a few hours, we got this:
</p>
<a href="https://replit.com/@TheEnquirer/SwiftLeafyTransfer#script.mjs" > -> the codes </a>!
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="new_init.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p>
A total mess. The above simulation pairs nodes by score similarity, and displays the score of each node with its size. The graph barely has any structure, and seems to writhe in pain over its own existence. Just like Albert and I after a few more hours of trying to debug.
</p>

<p>
We changed the colors to match intution as well, meaning reds were rats, blues were angels, and greens were tit-for-tats (chameleons?).
With a score-similarty pairing, reds would quickly sink into vicous cycles, getting stuck into minima and playing eachother. After a lot of iterations, the graphs looked something like this:
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-evenly;">
<img src="reds_together.png" width="45%"> </img>
<img src="reds_together_2.png" width="45%"> </img>
</div>

<h3 id="ps2">
v2.2 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    \text{random} : \{ \emptyset \} \to [0,1]
    \)</span>
</h3>
<p>
Random pairings resulted in the following:
</p>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="random_pairing_new.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p>
With random pairings -- as expected -- reds would dominate. Blues would be middling, and tit-for-tats were consistently losing.
But the graph was still a mess. This version was bassically a glorified histogram.
</p>
<p>
After a few more hours of fiddling with constants, normalization techniques, and different pairing functions, we gave up.
</p>
<h1 id="ps2">outro</h1>
<p>
The sim didn't work. Some of the results were alright, but I wasn't even nearly satisfied with what we had, even after restarts and hours of tinkering. It just didn't work.
