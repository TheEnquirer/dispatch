Because the sim never really ended up working.. instead of a video, I'm making a sorta blogpost type thing instead.
</p>
<p>
I initially was working on the Games on Graphs module with the large group, then broke off to work on a different type of sim right before the presentation. Instead of a histogram, I wanted to actually <i>see</i> the graph change and evolve. So, initially, I made this:
<h2 id="ps2">v.1</h1>
</p>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="initial_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p> 
This code ran the game on every click. It accepted a pairwise function for two nodes that retured a probability of their connection. This function was ran for every pair, forming the weighted edges, then the node would play along its highest weighted edge. (Nodes priority was selected in a random order, and then both nodes were removed from the pool once they played a game).
</p>
<p>
The game above was played with the pairwise function 
 <p><span class="math display">\[p(x, y) = \frac{x}{y}\]</span></p>
where
<td><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></td> 
is the score total of the source node, and 
<td><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></td> 
is the score total of the target node.
</p>
<p>
And some patterns started to emerge -- the red nodes would group together towards the center, opposite a cluster of blue nodes with greens in between them. But it wasn't really that comphresensible. The graph was far from elucidating. I tried playing with a lot of constants, and trying many different pairwise functions. A couple of the highlights are:
</p>
<h3 id="ps2">
v1.2 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    p(x, y) = \sin ^{2}(x)+\sin ^{2}(y)
    \)</span>
</h3>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="sinsr_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<p> 
This one would form a sort of star shape in the middle, often with blues and greens on the outside spikes.
The surface of this function is:

<h3 id="ps2">
v1.3 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    \text{random} : \{ \emptyset \} \to [0,1]
    \)</span>
</h3>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="random_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>
<h3 id="ps2">
v1.4 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    \frac{|x-y|}{x+y}
    \)</span>
</h3>

<p> 
This one was pretty cool -- it would form two hemispheres which were internally strongly connected and weakly connected across the two halves. Each hemisphere was color consistent, with a mix of greens (which makes sense as they are meant to be chameleons).
</p>
<p> 
Here's what it looks like with 200 nodes (beware, a bit laggy in the middle):
</p>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="dived_dif_large_c.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
</video>

<h3 id="ps2">
v1.5 :: <span class="math inline">\(
    |\ln(x) - \ln(y)|
    \)</span>
</h3>
<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 5px"> 
  <source src="log_difs_c.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<p> 
This one would form either seperate components dominated by one color but interestingly not homogenous. Sometimes the groups would steal nodes from eachother, or bridge themselves with nodes forming a long chaing or two distinct barely connected large groups.
</p>
<p> 
Here it is with 200 nodes, which tends to form lots of distinct almost-homogenous groups that are connected in a chain more clearly.

    but I wasn't happy.
</p>
</h2>
<p>
The graph didn't evolve in the way I wanted, and the code was filled with janky hacks and bugs from prolonged constant-fiddling and functionality tinkering. After hours, I finally gave up on my code. 
</p>
<p>
I resolved to rewrite it from scratch. But this time, I'd do it with the cavalry.
